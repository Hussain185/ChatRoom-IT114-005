<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In the initial implementation, I integrated a coin toss function that randomly selects<br>between &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;. The system first determines if the user&#39;s input is<br>&quot;flip&quot;, &quot;toss&quot;, or &quot;coin&quot;. Upon recognizing these commands, it activates the random number<br>generator, labeled &quot;rand&quot;, which provides either a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; outcome. A &quot;true&quot;<br>result translates to &quot;heads&quot;, while &quot;false&quot; denotes &quot;tails&quot;. Additionally, I&#39;ve incorporated a method<br>named &quot;getClientName&quot; which, for the present context, assigns the name &quot;Bob&quot; to the<br>user. Consequently, when the coin toss function is triggered, it retrieves the name<br>from this method, leading to a response like &quot;Bob flipped a coin and<br>got heads&quot; or the alternate with tails.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>For the second version of the game, I made a simple number guessing<br>game where all players can try to guess the number while the game<br>is going on. Here's how it works:</div><div>When someone sends a message that says<br>"start," and the game hasn't started yet, the code begins the game. It<br>picks a secret number, tells all players that the game has started, and<br>returns "true."</div><div>If someone sends a message that says "stop" while the game is<br>active, the code stops the game, tells everyone that the game has ended,<br>and treats further guesses as regular messages.</div><div>When a message starts with "guess," the<br>code checks if the game is active. If it is, the code figures<br>out the number in the message and checks if it matches the secret<br>number. If it's correct, the code says the player guessed right. If it's<br>wrong, the code says the player guessed wrong.</div><div>If none of these conditions are<br>met, the code informs everyone that the game isn't active, and the player's<br>guess won't count.</div><div><br></div><div>Additionally, there are two functions:</div><div>checkGuess compares the player's guess to the<br>secret number and tells them if they got it right or wrong.</div><div>generateRandomNumber creates<br>a random number between 1 and 10.</div><div>getClientName provides the user's name, which in<br>this case is "Bob."</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Did you have an issues and how did you resolve them? If no issues, what did you learn during this assignment that you found interesting?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In this assignment, I gained knowledge about controlling the flow of actions in<br>Java, particularly in setting up both a server and client on my computer.<br>Additionally, I learned how to include multiple clients in the server&#39;s network and<br>create a way for them to communicate with each other. This required me<br>to grasp the process of handling the transfer of information and messages between<br>these clients and the server, allowing them to interact and share data smoothly.<br></p><br></td></tr>
